				<p>Welcome to Ward 5 Code Camp (the “Site”).   This website is operated by Global Entrepreneurship Collective, Inc. and/or its affiliates (referred to as “GEC”, “we” or “us”).   GEC is a non-profit organization that runs the Ward 5 Software Coding Programs.</p>
				<p>This Enrollment Agreement (“Enrollment Agreement”), GEC’s Privacy Policy [Link] (“Privacy Policy”) and any other polices referenced in or incorporated into this Enrollment Agreement contain the terms (the “Terms”) upon which we are willing to provide you with the Ward 5 Software Coding Program (the “Program”).  “You” refers to the reader of this Enrollment Agreement.  This Enrollment Agreement and the Terms form an agreement between you and GEC.  Prior to enrolling in the Program, you must read and accept all of the Terms and links in this Enrollment Agreement and the participant in the program.   Enrollment in the Program constitutes your acceptance of the Terms.  If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you may not enroll in and attend the Program.  Please scroll down through the Terms (accessing and reading the linked information) to review important provisions regarding Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability, waivers and other legal restrictions.  If you have questions regarding these Terms, please contact GEC at code@globalecollective.org Attn: Nick Wichert – Enrollment Agreement.</p></br>  	
				<b>License</b>
				<p>By enrolling in the Program, you have a limited license to use the provided materials for educational use subject to any other terms and conditions of use in these Terms or on the Site or as specified in such materials.  These Terms cannot be waived or modified by any oral communication between you and GEC.</p></br>
				<b>Updating Terms</b>
				<p>We reserve the right to change, delete, and update portions of these Terms or other policies that govern the Program  at our discretion.  You should review these Terms periodically for changes.  Any amendments and/or modifications by GEC will be prospective only, and unless otherwise provided in this Enrollment Agreement, will be effective upon posting to the Site.  The Terms can be accessed from the link at the bottom of each page of the Site.  If you continue your enrollment in the Program after we post changes to the Terms, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms.</p></br>  
				<b>Enrollment in the Program</b>

By accepting these terms you are enrolling in and agreeing to make a one-time payment of all tuition, fees and charges associated with attendance no later than seven (7) days before the Program begins (the “Due Date”).You are responsible for timely paying all fees and applicable taxes.  Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.  If you fail to make timely payment, you will be charged 5% interest every 7 days the payment is late.  GEC may, in its sole and absolute discretion, rescind your enrollment in the program if you do not pay. We reserve the right to collect fees owed by all available legal means and you will be responsible for also paying the costs we incur as a result of such collection efforts, including our attorneys’ fees and expenses.<p></br>

				<p>4.	that you will comply with the Terms and all applicable laws.</p>	</br>
				<b>Refunds</b>

				<b>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</b>
				<p>YOU (i) ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RISK ARISING OUT OF PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM; (ii) RELEASE, WAIVE AND DISCHARGE GEC AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, VOLUNTEERS, CONTRACTORS, INVITEES AND EMPLOYEES (COLLECTIVELY THE “GEC RELATED PARTIES”) FROM ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM UNDER THIS ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF GEC; AND (iii) HOLD HARMLESS THE GEC RELATED PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL LOSS, DAMAGE, CAUSE OF ACTION, LIABILITY, PENALTY, COST, FEE OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING COURT COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO (A) GEC’S ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM, (B) ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OF OMISSION OF THE GEC RELATED PARTIES, OR © ANY BREACH OF THIS ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT BY GEC.</p>

				<b>Severability and Waiver</b>
				<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.  
				GEC’s failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver.  Any waiver by GEC of a breach of any provision of these Terms shall not be a waiver of any other breach and shall not be construed to be a modification of the Terms unless and until agreed to in writing by GEC.</p></br>
