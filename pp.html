				<p><center>Global Entrepreneurship Collective, Inc.</p></center>
				<p><center>Privacy Policy</p></center>
				
				<p><center>Updated: November 10, 2014</p></center></br>
				
				<p>Welcome to the website of Global Entrepreneurship Collective, Inc. (“GEC”). The following privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy" or “Policy”) states GEC’s policy relative to the information, including personal data and other information, collected from users to 5ward.com (the “Website”) and any functionality and services offered on or through the Website.<p></p></br>
				
				<p><b>Your Consent</b></p>
				
				<p>GEC reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page. By using the Website, you consent to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Website indicates acceptance of those modified terms. </p></br>
				
				<p><b>Information Collected</b></p>
				
				<p>When you visit GEC using this Website, GEC may collect personal data from you.  The data collected includes the following:<p>
				
				<p><i>Personal Information</i>.  GEC only collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis.  This information is provided to GEC by the user through the completion and submission of forms, inquiries, and other similar means.  “Personal Information” may include, but is not limited to, a user’s name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. The voluntary provision of such information indicates the user’s consent to GEC’s use of the Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.</p>  
				
				<p><i>Non-Personal Information</i>.  When you interact with GEC via this Website, GEC receives and stores certain personally non-identifiable information (“Non-Personal Information”).  Non-Personal Information, which is passively collected using various technologies, cannot be used to identify a specific user.  GEC may store such information itself or in databases owned and maintained by GEC affiliates, agents, or service providers.  GEC may aggregate personally non-identifiable information.</p>  
				
				<p><i>Cookies</i>. In connection with the operation of this Website, GEC may employ the use of technology commonly known as “cookies.”  A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to the Internet browser of a user to that website.  A cookie is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on the user’s computer or instruct it to perform any step or function.  The cookie does not extract any Personal Information.<p>
				
				<p><b>Use of Information Collected</b></p>
				
				<p>GEC uses Personal Information a user provides in a manner consistent with this Policy.  If a user provides Personal Information for a specific reason, GEC will use the Personal Information for the purpose it was provided.  GEC, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents may use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information collected through the Website to improve the content and functionality of the Website.  GEC also uses Personal Information to send marketing and other communications to users of the Website. By providing Personal Information to GEC through the Website, a user consents to these uses of that Personal Information.</p>
				
				<p>GEC may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of GEC, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users to the Website, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p></br>
				
				<p><b>Disclosure of Information Collected</b></p>
				
				<p>GEC will not sell, license, transmit, or disclose information collected to parties unaffiliated with GEC unless such sale, license, transmittal, or disclosure is expressly authorized by the user or required or permitted by law.  In all cases, GEC will disclose information collected consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and will require the recipient of such information to protect the information and use it only for the purpose it was provided.</p></br>
				
				<p><b>Exclusions</b></p>
				
				<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by GEC other than Personal Information collected through this Website.  GEC shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute any unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Website, any ideas for new information, resources, products or services, and other unsolicited submissions.</p> </br>
